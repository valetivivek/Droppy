TAGLINE:
Turn your MacBook notch into a file shelf, media controller, and productivity hub


---

DESCRIPTION:

Hey everyone! 👋

I've spent the past couple of months turning the MacBook notch (you know, that black bar everyone hates) into something actually useful. What started as a weekend project has grown into a full-featured productivity tool.

Here's what it does:

📁 File Shelf
Drop anything on your notch and it stays there. Drag it out when you need it. Simple as that. Works with AirDrop too - just drop files into the AirDrop zone and share instantly.

🎵 Media Player
Your music lives in the notch now. Album art, controls, real-time audio visualizer that actually reacts to what's playing. It even shows a glowing ambient light that matches your album art.

⌨️ Terminal in Your Notch
This one's for the devs - hit a shortcut, type a command, get instant results. Quick scripts, git commands, whatever you need. All without leaving what you're working on.

📋 Clipboard History
Every copy is saved. Search through it, favorite stuff, paste with a shortcut. Never lose that thing you copied 20 minutes ago.

🧠 AI Background Removal
Right-click any image, remove the background locally. No cloud, no upload, no privacy concerns. Just works.

Recent updates since I last posted:
• Completely rebuilt the notch "face" with buttery smooth 120fps animations 
• Real audio visualizer that responds to actual system audio
• Terminal-in-notch with timeout protection (won't freeze anymore!)
• Extension store redesign with better discovery
• Zero-lag first drops (used to stutter, fixed that)
• AirPods connection HUD with battery levels
• Focus/DND indicator
• Multi-monitor support that actually works
• Auto-expand when you hover with files

The whole thing is built in pure Swift, no Electron, tiny ~24MB footprint. It's free, open-source, and runs on GitHub if you want to peek at the code.

Works on any MacBook with a notch, and also supports Dynamic Island-style on external displays or older Macs.

Would love to hear what you think, and happy to answer any questions!

FIRST COMMENT:

Hey! I'm Jordy, the solo developer behind Droppy. Been using a MacBook Pro for a few years and always felt like that notch was just... wasted space. 

This is my attempt to make it useful. Built it in Swift because I wanted it to feel native (and honestly, Electron apps on Mac drive me a little crazy).

A few things I'm particularly proud of:
• The audio visualizer samples real system audio through ScreenCaptureKit
• The AI background removal runs entirely on-device using InSPyReNet
• Multi-monitor support was a nightmare to get right but it works now
• The NotchFace character has this little wink animation that I spent way too long perfecting

It's completely free. No Pro version, no subscription, nothing. Open source on GitHub with GPL-3.0 license.

I'm around all day if you have questions or feedback. Especially interested in hearing about edge cases or things that feel broken.

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏
