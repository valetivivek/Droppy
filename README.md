## What is Droppy?

Droppy reimagines productivity on macOS by combining three essential tools into one seamless experience:

1.  **Notch Shelf**: A sleek holding zone hidden in your webcam notch.
2.  **Floating Basket**: Summon a drop zone anywhere with a quick mouse jiggle.
3.  **Clipboard Manager**: A powerful history tool with OCR, favorites, and instant search.

It's the perfect bridge between your apps, spaces, and workflow.

| **📋 Clipboard Manager** | A powerful clipboard history with full **keyboard navigation**, **search**, **favorites**, and **OCR text extraction**. |

### 2. Quick Actions 🪄
Right-click any item to:
- **Move To...** — Send to saved favorites or NAS folders
- **Compress** — Auto or specify a target size
- **Convert** — e.g., HEIC → JPEG
- **Extract Text** — OCR to copy text from images
- **Share** or **Reveal in Finder**

### 3. Drop Files 📤
Drag files out of the shelf and drop into any app — email, Discord, Photoshop, Finder.  
**Poof** — the file moves and vanishes from the shelf.

## 🛠️ Power User Tips

### 📉 Smart Compression
- **Auto**: Uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images
- **Target Size**: Need under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...**
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger, Droppy keeps the original and shows a Green Shield 🛡️

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
1. Drag an image into Droppy
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out
3. Drop into a text editor — **it's text!**

---

## 📥 Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install --cask iordv/tap/droppy
```

### Manual Download
1. Download [**Droppy.dmg**](https://github.com/iordv/Droppy/releases/latest)
2. Drag to Applications
3. **Right-click → Open** on first launch

> **Quarantine Issue?** If macOS says the app is damaged:
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Droppy.app
> ```
