## What is Droppy?

Droppy provides a **temporary shelf** for your files. Drag files to the top of your screen (the Notch) or "jiggle" your mouse to summon a Basket right where you are. It's the perfect holding zone when moving files between apps, spaces, or folders.

🚀 **Version 2.3.2 is here!** Now fully **Universal** (Intel & Apple Silicon), with better compression and size guards.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🗂️ Notch Shelf** | Drag files to the Notch. They vanish into a sleek shelf, ready when you are. |
| **🧺 Floating Basket** | **"Jiggle" your mouse** while dragging to summon a basket instantly at your cursor. |
| **📉 Smart Compression** | Right-click to compress Images, PDFs, and Videos. Now with **Size Guard** 🛡️ to prevent bloat. |
| **⚡️ Fast Actions** | Convert images/docs, extract text (OCR), zip, or rename directly in the shelf. |

## 🕹️ Usage

### 1. Stash it 📥
- **Notch**: Drag any file to the black area around your webcam. It snaps in.
- **Basket**: While dragging a file, **shake your mouse cursor** left and right. A basket appears under your pointer.

### 2. Tweak it 🪄
- **Hover** over the Notch or Basket to see your files.
- **Right-click** any item to:
    - **Compress** (Auto or Target Size).
    - **Convert** (e.g., HEIC towards JPEG).
    - **extract Text** (Copy text from images).
    - **Share** or **Reveal in Finder**.

### 3. Drop it 📤
- Drag the file out of the shelf and drop it into your email, Discord, Photoshop, or Finder folder.
- **Poof**: The file is moved (or copied) and vanishes from the shelf.

## 🛠️ Power User Tools

### 📉 Intelligent Compression (New in v2.3)
Droppy doesn't just squash files; it optimizes them.
- **Smart Defaults**: "Auto" uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images.
- **Target Size**: Need a JPEG under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...** and tell it exactly what you need.
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger (common with some PDFs), Droppy **shakes no** and pulses a Green Shield 🛡️ to let you know it kept the original.

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
Need text from an image?
1. Drag an image into Droppy.
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out.
3. Drop it into a text editor. **Boom. It's text.**

## 🆕 What's New
<!-- CHANGELOG_START -->
# New
- **Move Files**: You can now move files directly to a destination (like a network drive/NAS) from the context menu. Droppy remembers your recent destinations for quick access!
