## 📦 Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install --cask iordv/tap/droppy
```

### Manual Download
1. Download [**Droppy.dmg**](https://github.com/iordv/Droppy/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG and drag Droppy to Applications
3. **Important:** Before first launch, run this command in Terminal:
   ```bash
   xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Droppy.app
   ```
4. Open Droppy from your Applications folder

> ⚠️ **"Droppy is damaged and can't be opened"?**
> 
> This happens because macOS quarantines apps downloaded from the internet. The `xattr` command above removes this flag. This is safe — Droppy is open source and you can verify the code yourself.
>
> Alternatively, use **Homebrew** which handles this automatically.

## 🕹️ How to Use

### Stash Files
- **Notch**: Drag any file to the black area around your webcam
- **Basket**: While dragging, **shake your mouse left-right** — a basket appears at your cursor

### Quick Actions
Right-click any item in the shelf to:
- **Move To...** — Send to saved locations
- **Compress** — Auto or specify a target size
- **Convert** — e.g., HEIC → JPEG
- **Extract Text** — OCR to copy text from images
- **Share** or **Reveal in Finder**

### Drop Files
Drag files out of the shelf and drop into any app. The file moves and vanishes from the shelf.

### Clipboard Manager

| Action | Shortcut |
|:-------|:---------|
| Open | `⌘ + Shift + Space` |
| Navigate | `↑` `↓` Arrow keys |
| Paste | `Enter` |
| Search | `⌘ + F` |
| Favorite | Click ⭐ |

> Works everywhere — even in password fields and Terminal.

## 🔮 Alfred Integration

Push files from Finder to Droppy using Alfred!

1. Open **Droppy Settings** → **About** → **Install in Alfred**
2. Select files in Finder → Activate Alfred → Type "Actions"
3. Choose **Add to Droppy Shelf** or **Add to Droppy Basket**

> Requires Alfred 4+ with Powerpack

---

## 🛠️ Pro Tips

### Smart Compression
- **Auto**: Balanced settings for most files
- **Target Size**: Need under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...**
- **Size Guard** 🛡️: If compression would make the file larger, Droppy keeps the original

### Drag-and-Drop OCR
1. Drag an image into Droppy
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out
3. Drop into a text editor — **it's text!**

### Auto-Hide Basket
Enable in Settings → Basket → **Auto-Hide**. The basket slides to the screen edge when not in use and peeks out on hover.

# Droppy v5.4.1 - Stability & Interaction Fixes

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### File Transfer Stability
- **Fixed file corruption** — Files no longer get corrupted when moved between Basket and Shelf multiple times
- **Fixed ZIP creation failures** — Zipping now works reliably after repeated file transfers

### Auto-Hide Basket
- **Fixed "peek" not hiding** — Basket now properly slides to the edge when you move your cursor away after dropping files
- **Improved drop detection** — Better mouse tracking for drag-and-drop operations

### Shelf Interaction
- **Instant drag from shelf** — Files can now be dragged immediately without clicking to activate first
- **Matches basket behavior** — Both shelf and basket now support first-click interaction
