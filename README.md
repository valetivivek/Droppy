## What is Droppy?

Droppy provides a **temporary file shelf** that lives in your Mac's notch. Drag files to the top of your screen or **"jiggle"** your mouse to summon a floating basket anywhere. It's the perfect holding zone when moving files between apps, spaces, or folders.

## 🛠️ Power User Tips

### 📉 Smart Compression
- **Auto**: Uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images
- **Target Size**: Need under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...**
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger, Droppy keeps the original and shows a Green Shield 🛡️

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
1. Drag an image into Droppy
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out
3. Drop into a text editor — **it's text!**

---

## 📥 Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)
