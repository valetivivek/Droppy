## What is Droppy?

Droppy provides a **temporary shelf** for your files. Drag files to the top of your screen (the Notch) or "jiggle" your mouse to summon a Basket right where you are. It's the perfect holding zone when moving files between apps, spaces, or folders.

## 🛠️ Power User Tools

### 📉 Intelligent Compression (New in v2.3)
Droppy doesn't just squash files; it optimizes them.
- **Smart Defaults**: "Auto" uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images.
- **Target Size**: Need a JPEG under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...** and tell it exactly what you need.
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger (common with some PDFs), Droppy **shakes no** and pulses a Green Shield 🛡️ to let you know it kept the original.

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
Need text from an image?
1. Drag an image into Droppy.
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out.
3. Drop it into a text editor. **Boom. It's text.**

---

## 🆕 What's New
<!-- CHANGELOG_START -->
# Droppy v2.7.1: Editor Polish & Critical Fixes 🛠️

*This release reinforces v2.7.0 with critical stability improvements.*

This release marks a major milestone for Droppy, bringing the **Clipboard Manager** to full maturity and introducing significant architectural improvements for stability.

### 📋 Liquid Clipboard Manager
- **Direct Content Editing**: Edit text and URLs directly in the history. The UI morphs seamlessly into a dedicated editor.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Copying an existing item now intelligently moves it to the top without creating duplicates.
- **Persistent Metadata**: Your "Favorites" and "Renamed Titles" are preserved even if you copy the item again.
- **Visual History**: Rich previews for text, images, files, and colors.
- **Fluid Animations**: "Marching ants" animations for search, rename, and editing modes indicate active states clearly.
- **Drag & Drop**: Seamlessly drag items from history directly to the Shelf, Basket, or other apps.

### 🛡️ Core Stability & Performance
- **Crash Fixed**: Resolved a critical crash (`objc_release`) affecting the Notch Window by separating high-frequency interaction logic (50ms) from heavy environment checks.
- **Animation Fixes**: Eliminated `CoreAnimation` transaction crashes during fullscreen transitions.
- **Optimization**: Reduced CPU and Memory usage by 20x for background visibility checks.

### 🧺 Basket & Shelf
- **Refined**: Improved click-through behavior and "Jiggle" detection accuracy.

Update now for the smoothest, most stable Droppy experience yet! 🚀
