## What is Droppy?

Droppy reimagines productivity on macOS by combining three essential tools into one seamless experience:

1.  **Notch Shelf**: A sleek holding zone hidden in your webcam notch.
2.  **Floating Basket**: Summon a drop zone anywhere with a quick mouse jiggle.
3.  **Clipboard Manager**: A powerful history tool with OCR, favorites, and instant search.

It's the perfect bridge between your apps, spaces, and workflow.

| **🧺 Floating Basket** | **"Jiggle" your mouse** while dragging to summon a basket instantly at your cursor. |
| **📋 Clipboard Manager** | A powerful clipboard history with full **keyboard navigation**, **search**, **favorites**, and **OCR text extraction**. |
| **📦 Move To...** | Move files directly to saved folders (like your NAS) from the shelf. Non-blocking & fast. |
| **📉 Smart Compression** | Right-click to compress images, PDFs, and videos. Includes **Target Size** and **Size Guard** 🛡️. |

## 🕹️ Usage

### 1. Stash Files 📥
- **Notch Shelf**: Drag any file to the black area around your webcam. It snaps in.
- **Floating Basket**: While dragging, **shake your mouse left-right**. A basket appears instantly.

### 2. Quick Actions 🪄
Right-click any item to:
- **Move To...** — Send to saved favorites or NAS folders
- **Compress** — Auto or specify a target size
- **Convert** — e.g., HEIC → JPEG
- **Extract Text** — OCR to copy text from images
- **Share** or **Reveal in Finder**

### 3. Drop Files 📤
Drag files out of the shelf and drop into any app — email, Discord, Photoshop, Finder.  
**Poof** — the file moves and vanishes from the shelf.

### 4. Clipboard Manager 📋
| Action | How |
|:-------|:----|
| **Open** | `Cmd + Shift + Space` (customizable) |
| **Navigate** | Arrow keys to browse entries |
| **Paste** | `Enter` to paste instantly |
| **Search** | `Cmd + F` or click the search icon |
| **Favorite** | Click ⭐ — favorites float to the top |

### 📥 Smarter Links
- **Rich Interactive Previews**: Every URL now shows a detailed snippet with page titles, descriptions, and favicons.
- **Click to Open**: Click any link preview to jump straight to your browser. The clipboard closes automatically for a seamless workflow.
- **Direct Image Previews**: Links directly to images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.avif`, etc.) display the actual image directly in your history.
- **Smart Detection**: Accurate plain-text link detection (even without `http://`) via `NSDataDetector`.

> **Works everywhere** — even in password fields and Terminal, thanks to low-level hotkey support.

## 🛠️ Power User Tips

### 📉 Smart Compression
- **Auto**: Uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images
- **Target Size**: Need under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...**
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger, Droppy keeps the original and shows a Green Shield 🛡️

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
1. Drag an image into Droppy
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out
3. Drop into a text editor — **it's text!**

---

## 📥 Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew install --cask iordv/tap/droppy
```

### Manual Download
1. Download [**Droppy.dmg**](https://github.com/iordv/Droppy/releases/latest)
2. Drag to Applications
3. **Right-click → Open** on first launch

> **Quarantine Issue?** If macOS says the app is damaged:
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Droppy.app
> ```

## 🆕 What's New
<!-- CHANGELOG_START -->
# Release Notes v3.2.7

### 🚀 Major Improvements to URL Handling
- **Rich Interactive URL Previews**: Link previews are now fully interactive. Click any preview card to open the link in your default browser.
- **Auto-Close Clipboard**: For a smoother workflow, the clipboard window now automatically closes after you click a link, letting you focus on your browsing.
- **Enhanced Preview Metadata**: URL previews now include website snapshots with titles, descriptions, and favicons, providing more context at a glance.
- **Improved Link Detection**: Smarter plain-text link detection using `NSDataDetector`, allowing Droppy to recognize URLs even when they lack `http://` or `www.`.
- **Expanded Media Support**: Direct image previews now support `.avif` and `.apng` formats, with improved detection for common image hosting sites.

### 🍱 Refined Workspace & UI
- **20% Wider Clipboard Window**: Increased the maximum width of the clipboard window from 864px to **1040px**. This provides a more spacious layout for rich content and ensures the preview pane feels premium and uncrowded.
- **Matched Action Badges**: The "Website" and "Image Link" badges have been restyled to exactly match the "Extract Text" button's aesthetic, including its ultra-thin material background, refined overlay, and subtle shadow.
- **Title Case Badges**: Updated badge labels to a cleaner Title Case for a more modern, integrated appearance.
- **Borderless Aesthetic**: Removed borders and internal backgrounds from URL previews for a cleaner, glass-like look that blends perfectly with Droppy's design language.

### 🧹 Code Health & DX
- Fixed various compiler warnings related to unused values and results.
- Optimized MainActor synchronization for smoother UI transitions.
- Improved coordinate conversion logic in multi-monitor setups.
