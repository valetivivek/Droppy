## What is Droppy?

Droppy turns your MacBook notch into something actually useful. Drop files into it, stash them, drag them out anywhere. That's the core — a fast, native file shelf that stays out of your way.

Everything else is optional. Want clipboard history? Turn it on. Media controls with a live visualizer? It's there. Voice transcription, AI background removal, a terminal right in your notch, window snapping — all available as lightweight extensions you install only if you want them.

The app itself is tiny. It launches instantly, never lags, and feels like it belongs on macOS because it's built entirely in Swift. No Electron, no web views.

Keep it minimal or stack it with everything. Either way, it's free, open-source, and replaces a dozen separate tools.

---

## 🎵 Shelf & Media Player

Your notch becomes a **media powerhouse**. See stunning album art, control playback with tap-to-seek, skip tracks, shuffle, and repeat—all without leaving your workflow. The live **audio visualizer** dances to your music in real-time. Drop files into the shelf and drag them out anywhere.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/images/shelf-demo.gif" alt="Shelf & Media Player" width="100%">
</p>

---

## 📋 Clipboard Manager

Never lose a copy again. Your **full clipboard history** with instant search, favorites, and rich previews. Push items to your shelf or basket, rename entries, extract text with **OCR**, and bulk-copy multiple items at once. Open with `⌘ + Shift + Space` (customizable).

<p align="center">

## 🧺 Floating Basket

**Jiggle your mouse** to summon a floating basket anywhere on screen. Drop files in, push to shelf, convert formats, compress, extract text, remove backgrounds, share—all from a beautiful context menu. Enable drag-to-summon for instant access, and enjoy smooth **peek and hide** animations.

---

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Droppy really free?</strong></summary>

Yes! Droppy is completely free forever—no ads, no subscriptions, no hidden fees, no paywalls. Every feature, including all extensions like Voice Transcribe and AI Background Removal, is included at no cost. We believe great software should be accessible to everyone.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Droppy is damaged and can't be opened" — how do I fix this?</strong></summary>

This is macOS Gatekeeper blocking apps that aren't notarized through Apple. It's a safety feature, not an actual problem with the app. To fix it, open Terminal and run:
```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Droppy.app
```
If you downloaded the DMG directly, run this instead:
```bash
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Droppy-*.dmg
```
**Pro tip:** Installing via Homebrew (`brew install --cask iordv/tap/droppy`) avoids this issue entirely and keeps Droppy automatically updated.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work on Macs without a notch?</strong></summary>

Absolutely! On Macs without a notch (like iMacs, Mac minis, or older MacBooks), Droppy displays a sleek **Dynamic Island-style pill** at the top center of your screen. You get all the same features—shelf, media controls, HUDs, clipboard—just in a beautiful floating pill that matches the iPhone's Dynamic Island aesthetic.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data private?</strong></summary>

100% private. Droppy is designed with privacy-first principles:
- **Clipboard history** stays on your Mac—never uploaded anywhere
- **Voice transcription** uses on-device AI (WhisperKit)—audio never leaves your Mac
- **AI background removal** runs locally using Apple's ML framework
- **No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry** that identifies you
- The app is open-source, so you can verify this yourself
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does Droppy need Accessibility permissions?</strong></summary>

Accessibility is the only **required** permission and enables Droppy's core features:
- **Global keyboard shortcuts** (like ⌘+Shift+Space to open clipboard)
- **Drag detection** to show the floating basket when you're moving files
- **Media key interception** to display custom volume/brightness HUDs
- **Mouse jiggle detection** to summon the basket

Droppy never reads your keystrokes, screen content, or any personal data. The permission is purely for detecting gestures and shortcuts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why does Droppy need Screen Recording permission?</strong></summary>

Screen Recording is **optional** and only needed for two specific features:
- **Element Capture extension**: Screenshots individual UI elements by clicking on them
- **Audio Visualizer**: Captures system audio output to display the live frequency spectrum

If you don't use these features, you don't need to grant this permission. Droppy works perfectly fine without it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use Droppy on multiple monitors?</strong></summary>

Yes! Droppy fully supports multi-monitor setups:
- The notch/island appears on each connected display
- **Smart fullscreen detection** automatically hides when apps go fullscreen
- The shelf expands only on the screen where you're interacting
- HUDs appear on the display with your active cursor
- Works seamlessly with external monitors, including ultrawide displays
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I change the keyboard shortcuts?</strong></summary>

Open Droppy's Settings (click the gear icon in the shelf, or right-click the menu bar icon) → **Shortcuts** tab. Here you can customize:
- Clipboard Manager shortcut (default: ⌘+Shift+Space)
- Window Snap shortcuts (if you have the extension)
- Voice Transcribe Quick Record (if you have the extension)
- And more

Click any shortcut field and press your desired key combination to record a new shortcut.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Droppy work with external keyboards?</strong></summary>

Yes! All keyboard shortcuts and media key interception work with any keyboard:
- Built-in MacBook keyboards
- External USB and Bluetooth keyboards
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- Third-party keyboards (Logitech, Keychron, etc.)

Media keys (play/pause, volume, brightness) are detected regardless of which keyboard you use.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I uninstall Droppy?</strong></summary>

**Simple uninstall:** Drag Droppy from the Applications folder to Trash.

**Complete removal** (including all data and preferences):
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Droppy
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/iordv.Droppy.plist
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/iordv.Droppy
```

**If you installed via Homebrew:**
```bash
brew uninstall droppy
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Droppy open-source?</strong></summary>

Yes! Droppy's full source code is available on GitHub under the **GPL-3.0 license with Commons Clause**. This means:
- ✅ Free to use, modify, and learn from
- ✅ You can build it yourself from source
- ✅ Contributions and pull requests are welcome
- ❌ Cannot be sold or used commercially without permission

We believe in transparency—you can see exactly what the app does and verify it respects your privacy.
