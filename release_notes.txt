# Droppy v4.4.2

## Critical Fix
- **Clipboard History**: Fixed race condition that could cause clipboard history to be overwritten with empty data during app launch

## Improvements  
- **Data Protection**: Clipboard now creates automatic backups before each save
- **Empty Save Guard**: Prevents saving empty clipboard history (protects against bugs)
- **Atomic Writes**: All clipboard saves now use atomic file operations for reliability
