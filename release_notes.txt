Droppy v3.3.8: Clipboard-to-Basket Dragging

This update fixes the issue where the basket would not appear when dragging items directly from the Clipboard Manager.

**Fixes & Improvements**
- **Unified Drag Monitoring**: `DragMonitor` now listens for both local and global drag events. This ensures that jiggle detection works perfectly even when Droppy is the frontmost application (e.g., when the Clipboard is open).
- **Z-Index Optimization**: Verified that the floating basket correctly appears on top of the Clipboard window for a seamless drag-and-drop experience.

This release follows the stability and performance improvements made in v3.3.7.
