Droppy v3.3.7: Stability Hotfix

This hotfix addresses a rare crash during file jiggles and further optimizes system resource usage.

**Fixes & Improvements**
- **Reactive Drag Monitoring**: Completely refactored the drag detection engine to use native macOS event monitors instead of a background polling loop. This eliminates potential race conditions in the HID event system and reduces idle CPU usage.
- **Animation Stability**: Added debouncing to the floating basket's movement animations to prevent overload during rapid jiggles.
- **Crash Prevention**: Resolved an `objc_release` issue in the system event queue reported by users.

This release builds on the memory optimizations and smooth animation improvements introduced in v3.3.6.
