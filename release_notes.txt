Droppy v3.3.6: Memory Optimization & Smooth UI

This update focuses on making Droppy more efficient while refining the feel of the interface.

**Memory Optimizations**
- **Disk-Based Clipboard**: Large image data in your clipboard history is now offloaded to disk. This significantly reduces RAM usage, especially for high-resolution images. Existing history will be migrated automatically on first launch.
- **Bounded Link Previews**: Optimized LinkPreviewService with NSCache to prevent unbounded memory growth over time.

**UI & Animations**
- **Smooth Basket Movement**: Re-introduced the "fly" animation for the floating basket. When you jiggle a file again, the basket now glides smoothly to the new position.
- **Polished Transitions**: Restored the elegant fade-in effect when summoning the basket.

**Stability**
- Maintained window lifecycle stability fixes from v3.3.5 to prevent AppKit crashes during rapid interaction.
